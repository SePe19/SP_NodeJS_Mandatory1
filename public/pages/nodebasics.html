<div id="container">
    <p>&emsp;Use the npm init command to create a package.json file for your application</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<code>npm init</code></p>
    <p>&emsp;Now you can edit what you would like to edit, or simply press enter until the file has been created.</p>
    <p>&emsp;You might want to change index.js to app.js, but it's up to you.</p>
</div><br>
<div id="container">
    <p>&emsp;Now you can create your very first Hello World in NodeJS:</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<code>app.get('/', (req, res) => {
        res.send('Hello World!')})
</code></p>
    <p>&emsp;req stands for request and res stands for response.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Note that req always comes before res.</p>
</div><br>
<div id="container">
    <p>&emsp;Next we need to make the app listen at a certain port:</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<code>app.listen(8080, () => {
        console.log("The server is running on port:", 8080)})
    </code></p>
    <p>&emsp;We have chosen port 8080 in this example, but you may choose your own.</p>
    <p>&emsp;you can also create your port outside of app.listen.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Note that app.listen is always at the very bottom of the JavaScript file.</p>
</div><br>
<div id="container">
    <p>&emsp;When you have created a working app you can run it by writing:
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<code>node app.js</code></p>
    <p>&emsp;Or whatever you have called your JavaScript file.</p>
